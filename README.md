## 🌟 Project Overview

This project simulates a basic e-commerce experience from both user and admin perspectives. It includes:

- 🔐 **User Signup** with email, password, name, and profile picture.  
  - The uploaded picture is stored in **AWS S3**, and the image URL is saved in the **MySQL** database.

- 🔓 **User Login** using email and password.

- 💖 **Wishlist (Cart)** functionality:
  - Each product shows a heart icon. Clicking the heart adds the product to the user's wishlist.
  - The wishlist is stored in the database, so it remains persistent even after logout or refresh.

- 🛍️ **Admin Product Management** (Tested):
  - Admin can add a product with name, description, price, and photo.
  - The photo is uploaded to S3, and product details are stored in the MySQL database.
  - Admin can also delete products.
